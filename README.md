Rubik's Cube solver that calculates each step needed to solve any cube. 
# About
This is a Rubik's Cube Solver implemented with Pythons module Pygame. The user can give an input any cube by either manually selecting a color for each square of the cube, clicking on the rotating buttons or clicking on the scramble button to randommly srambled the cube. When the solve button is clicked the program will dislay each rotation needed to solve the cube.

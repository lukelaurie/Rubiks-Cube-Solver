# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
Rubik's Cube solver that calculates each step needed to solve any cube. 
# About
This is a Rubik's Cube Solver implemented with Pythons module Pygame. The user can give an input any cube by either manually selecting a color for each square of the cube, clicking on the rotating buttons or clicking on the scramble button to randommly srambled the cube. When the solve button is clicked the program will dislay each rotation needed to solve the cube. The program also serves as a working Rubik's Cube where the user can press any button to turn the cube in whichever way they desire.

# The Algorithm 
This program utilzes a method known as the beginners method to solve the cube in 7 main steps. The steps are to solve the white cross, white corners, second layer, yellow cross, final edges final, corner alignment then to rotate the corners to complete the solve. https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/
This program runs a seven step 

# Requirements 
To run this program, both Python and Pygame need to be installed.
